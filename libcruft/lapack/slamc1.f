*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SLAMC1 determines the machine parameters given by BETA, T, RND, and
*  IEEE1.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  BETA    (output) INTEGER
*          The base of the machine.
*
*  T       (output) INTEGER
*          The number of ( BETA ) digits in the mantissa.
*
*  RND     (output) LOGICAL
*          Specifies whether proper rounding  ( RND = .TRUE. )  or
*          chopping  ( RND = .FALSE. )  occurs in addition. This may not
*          be a reliable guide to the way in which the machine performs
*          its arithmetic.
*
*  IEEE1   (output) LOGICAL
*          Specifies whether rounding appears to be done in the IEEE
*          'round to nearest' style.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The routine is based on the routine  ENVRON  by Malcolm and
*  incorporates suggestions by Gentleman and Marovich. See

*        floating-point arithmetic. Comms. of the ACM, 15, 949-951.

*
*        LBETA,  LIEEE1,  LT and  LRND  are the  local values  of  BETA,

*
*        Throughout this routine  we use the function  SLAMC3  to ensure
*        that relevant values are  stored and not held in registers,  or
*        are not affected by optimizers.
*
*        Compute  a = 2.0**m  with the  smallest positive integer m such
*        that
*
*           fl( a + 1.0 ) = a.
*
         A = 1
         C = 1
*
*+       WHILE( C.EQ.ONE )LOOP
   10    CONTINUE
         IF( C.EQ.ONE ) THEN
            A = 2*A
            C = SLAMC3( A, ONE )
            C = SLAMC3( C, -A )
            GO TO 10
         END IF
*+       END WHILE
*
*        Now compute  b = 2.0**m  with the smallest positive integer m
*        such that
*
*           fl( a + b ) .gt. a.
*
         B = 1
         C = SLAMC3( A, B )
*
*+       WHILE( C.EQ.A )LOOP
   20    CONTINUE
         IF( C.EQ.A ) THEN
            B = 2*B
            C = SLAMC3( A, B )
            GO TO 20
         END IF
*+       END WHILE
*
*        Now compute the base.  a and c  are neighbouring floating point
*        numbers  in the  interval  ( beta**t, beta**( t + 1 ) )  and so
*        their difference is beta. Adding 0.25 to c is to ensure that it
*        is truncated to beta and not ( beta - 1 ).
*
         QTR = ONE / 4
         SAVEC = C
         C = SLAMC3( C, -A )
         LBETA = C + QTR
*
*        Now determine whether rounding or chopping occurs,  by adding a
*        bit  less  than  beta/2  and a  bit  more  than  beta/2  to  a.
*
         B = LBETA
         F = SLAMC3( B / 2, -B / 100 )
         C = SLAMC3( F, A )
         IF( C.EQ.A ) THEN
            LRND = .TRUE.
         ELSE
            LRND = .FALSE.
         END IF
         F = SLAMC3( B / 2, B / 100 )
         C = SLAMC3( F, A )
         IF( ( LRND ) .AND. ( C.EQ.A ) )
     $      LRND = .FALSE.
*
*        Try and decide whether rounding is done in the  IEEE  'round to
*        nearest' style. B/2 is half a unit in the last place of the two
*        numbers A and SAVEC. Furthermore, A is even, i.e. has last  bit
*        zero, and SAVEC is odd. Thus adding B/2 to A should not  change
*        A, but adding B/2 to SAVEC should change SAVEC.
*
         T1 = SLAMC3( B / 2, A )
         T2 = SLAMC3( B / 2, SAVEC )
         LIEEE1 = ( T1.EQ.A ) .AND. ( T2.GT.SAVEC ) .AND. LRND
*
*        Now find  the  mantissa, t.  It should  be the  integer part of
*        log to the base beta of a,  however it is safer to determine  t
*        by powering.  So we find t as the smallest positive integer for
*        which
*
*           fl( beta**t + 1.0 ) = 1.0.
