# Originally written by Paul Eggert.  The canonical version of this
# script is maintained as top/autopull.sh in gnulib.  However, to be
# useful to your package, you should place a copy of it under version
# control in the top-level directory of your package.  The intent is
# that all customization can be done with a bootstrap.conf file also
# maintained in your version control; gnulib comes with a template
# build-aux/bootstrap.conf to get you started.
#
# Alternatively, you can use an autopull.sh script that is specific
# to your package.
