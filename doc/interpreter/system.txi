@node System Utilities
@chapter System Utilities

This chapter describes the functions that are available to allow you to
get information about what is happening outside of Octave, while it is
still running, and use this information in your program.  For example,
you can get information about environment variables, the current time,
and even start other programs from the Octave prompt.

@node Timing Utilities
@section Timing Utilities

Octave's core set of functions for manipulating time values are
patterned after the corresponding functions from the standard C library.
Several of these functions use a data structure for time that includes
the following elements:

@table @code
@item usec
Microseconds after the second (0-999999).

@item sec
Seconds after the minute (0-61).  This number can be 61 to account
for leap seconds.

@item min
Minutes after the hour (0-59).

@item hour
Hours since midnight (0-23).

@item mday
Day of the month (1-31).

@item mon
Months since January (0-11).

@item year
Years since 1900.

@item wday
Days since Sunday (0-6).

@item yday
Days since January 1 (0-365).

@item isdst
Daylight Savings Time flag.

@item zone
Time zone.
@end table

@noindent
In the descriptions of the following functions, this structure is
referred to as a @var{tm_struct}.

@DOCSTRING(ctime)

@DOCSTRING(gmtime)

@DOCSTRING(localtime)

@DOCSTRING(mktime)

@node Controlling Subprocesses
@section Controlling Subprocesses

Octave includes some high-level commands like @code{system} and
@code{popen} for starting subprocesses.  If you want to run another
program to perform some task and then look at its output, you will
probably want to use these functions.

Octave also provides several very low-level Unix-like functions which
can also be used for starting subprocesses, but you should probably only
use them if you can't find any way to do what you need with the
higher-level functions.

@DOCSTRING(system)

@DOCSTRING(unix)

@DOCSTRING(dos)

@DOCSTRING(perl)

@DOCSTRING(popen)

@DOCSTRING(pclose)

@DOCSTRING(popen2)

@DOCSTRING(EXEC_PATH)

In most cases, the following functions simply decode their arguments and
make the corresponding Unix system calls.  For a complete example of how
they can be used, look at the definition of the function @code{popen2}.

@DOCSTRING(fork)

@DOCSTRING(exec)

@DOCSTRING(pipe)

@DOCSTRING(dup2)

@DOCSTRING(waitpid)

@DOCSTRING(WCONTINUE)

@DOCSTRING(WCOREDUMP)

@section Password Database Functions

Octave's password database functions return information in a structure
with the following fields.

@table @code
@item name
The user name.

@item passwd
The encrypted password, if available.

@item uid
The numeric user id.

@item gid
The numeric group id.

@item gecos
The GECOS field.

@item dir
The home directory.

@item shell
The initial shell.
@end table

In the descriptions of the following functions, this data structure is
referred to as a @var{pw_struct}.

@DOCSTRING(getpwent)

@DOCSTRING(getpwuid)

@DOCSTRING(getpwnam)

@DOCSTRING(setpwent)

@DOCSTRING(endpwent)

The user name.

@item passwd

@item mem
The members of the group.

@node Hashing Functions
@section Hashing Functions

It is often necessary to find if two strings or files are
identical.  This might be done by comparing them character by character
and looking for differences.  However, this can be slow, and so comparing
a hash of the string or file can be a rapid way of finding if the files
differ.

Another use of the hashing function is to check for file integrity.  The
user can check the hash of the file against a known value and find if
the file they have is the same as the one that the original hash was
produced with.

Octave supplies the @code{md5sum} function to perform MD5 hashes on
strings and files.  An example of the use of @code{md5sum} function might
be

@example
@group
if exist (file, "file")
  hash = md5sum (file);
else
  # Treat the variable "file" as a string
  hash = md5sum (file, true);
endif
@end group
@end example

@DOCSTRING(md5sum)
