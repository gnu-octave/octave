*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLAMC5 attempts to compute RMAX, the largest machine floating-point
*  number, without overflow.  It assumes that EMAX + abs(EMIN) sum
*  approximately to a power of 2.  It will fail on machines where this
*  assumption does not hold, for example, the Cyber 205 (EMIN = -28625,
*  EMAX = 28718).  It will also fail if the value supplied for EMIN is
*  too large (i.e. too close to zero), probably with overflow.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  BETA    (input) INTEGER
*          The base of floating-point arithmetic.
*
*  P       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of base BETA digits in the mantissa of a
*          floating-point value.
*
*  EMIN    (input) INTEGER
*          The minimum exponent before (gradual) underflow.
*
*  IEEE    (input) LOGICAL
*          A logical flag specifying whether or not the arithmetic
*          system is thought to comply with the IEEE standard.
*
*  EMAX    (output) INTEGER
*          The largest exponent before overflow
*
*  RMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The largest machine floating-point number.

*
*     First compute LEXP and UEXP, two powers of 2 that bound
*     abs(EMIN). We then assume that EMAX + abs(EMIN) will sum
*     approximately to the bound that is closest to abs(EMIN).
*     (EMAX is the exponent of the required number RMAX).
*
      LEXP = 1
      EXBITS = 1
   10 CONTINUE
      TRY = LEXP*2
      IF( TRY.LE.( -EMIN ) ) THEN
         LEXP = TRY
         EXBITS = EXBITS + 1
         GO TO 10
      END IF
      IF( LEXP.EQ.-EMIN ) THEN
         UEXP = LEXP
      ELSE
         UEXP = TRY
         EXBITS = EXBITS + 1
      END IF
*
*     Now -LEXP is less than or equal to EMIN, and -UEXP is greater
*     than or equal to EMIN. EXBITS is the number of bits needed to
*     store the exponent.
*
      IF( ( UEXP+EMIN ).GT.( -LEXP-EMIN ) ) THEN
         EXPSUM = 2*LEXP
      ELSE
         EXPSUM = 2*UEXP
      END IF
*
*     EXPSUM is the exponent range, approximately equal to
*     EMAX - EMIN + 1 .
*
      EMAX = EXPSUM + EMIN - 1
      NBITS = 1 + EXBITS + P
*
*     NBITS is the total number of bits needed to store a
*     floating-point number.
*
      IF( ( MOD( NBITS, 2 ).EQ.1 ) .AND. ( BETA.EQ.2 ) ) THEN
*
*        Either there are an odd number of bits used to store a
*        floating-point number, which is unlikely, or some bits are
*        not used in the representation of numbers, which is possible,
*        (e.g. Cray machines) or the mantissa has an implicit bit,
*        (e.g. IEEE machines, Dec Vax machines), which is perhaps the
*        most likely. We have to assume the last alternative.
*        If this is true, then we need to reduce EMAX by one because
*        there must be some way of representing zero in an implicit-bit
*        system. On machines like Cray, we are reducing EMAX by one
*        unnecessarily.
*
         EMAX = EMAX - 1
      END IF
*
      IF( IEEE ) THEN
*
*        Assume we are on an IEEE machine which reserves one exponent
*        for infinity and NaN.
*
         EMAX = EMAX - 1
      END IF
*
*     Now create RMAX, the largest machine number, which should
*     be equal to (1.0 - BETA**(-P)) * BETA**EMAX .
*
*     First compute 1.0 - BETA**(-P), being careful that the
*     result is less than 1.0 .
*
      RECBAS = ONE / BETA
      Z = BETA - ONE
      Y = ZERO
      DO 20 I = 1, P
         Z = Z*RECBAS
         IF( Y.LT.ONE )
     $      OLDY = Y
         Y = DLAMC3( Y, Z )
   20 CONTINUE
      IF( Y.GE.ONE )
     $   Y = OLDY
*
*     Now multiply by BETA**EMAX to get RMAX.
*
      DO 30 I = 1, EMAX
         Y = DLAMC3( Y*BETA, ZERO )
   30 CONTINUE
*
      RMAX = Y
      RETURN
*
*     End of DLAMC5
