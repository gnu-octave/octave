      SUBROUTINE DGEFA(A,LDA,N,IPVT,INFO)
      INTEGER LDA,N,IPVT(1),INFO
      DOUBLE PRECISION A(LDA,1)
C
C     DGEFA FACTORS A DOUBLE PRECISION MATRIX BY GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION.
C
C     DGEFA IS USUALLY CALLED BY DGECO, BUT IT CAN BE CALLED
C     DIRECTLY WITH A SAVING IN TIME IF  RCOND  IS NOT NEEDED.
C     (TIME FOR DGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(TIME FOR DGEFA) .

C                THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX  A .
C
C     ON RETURN
C
C        A       AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX AND THE MULTIPLIERS
C                WHICH WERE USED TO OBTAIN IT.
C                THE FACTORIZATION CAN BE WRITTEN  A = L*U  WHERE
C                L  IS A PRODUCT OF PERMUTATION AND UNIT LOWER
C                TRIANGULAR MATRICES AND  U  IS UPPER TRIANGULAR.
