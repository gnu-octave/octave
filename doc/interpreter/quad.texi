@example
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ("f", a, b)
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ("f", a, b, tol)
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ("f", a, b, tol, sing)
@end example

Integrate a nonlinear function of one variable using Quadpack.

Where the first argument is the name of the  function to call to
compute the value of the integrand.  It must have the form

@example
y = f (x)
@end example

@noindent
where y and x are scalars.

The second and third arguments are limits of integration.  Either or
both may be infinite.

The optional argument tol is a vector that specifies the desired
accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired
absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative
tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute
tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative
tolerance to zero. 

The optional argument @var{sing} is a vector of values at which the
integrand is singular.

@findex quad_options
Tolerances and other options for @code{quad} may be specified using the
function @code{quad_options}.

@end example

Compute derivative and integral weight matrices for orthogonal
collocation using the subroutines given in J. Villadsen and
M. L. Michelsen, @cite{Solution of Differential Equation Models by
Polynomial Approximation}.
