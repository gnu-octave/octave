Summary of important user-visible changes for version 5.0 (yyyy-mm-dd):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The functions issymmetric and ishermitian accept an option "nonskew"
    or "skew" to calculate the symmetric or skew-symmetric property
    of a matrix.  Performance has also been increased.

 ** The issorted function now uses a direction option of "ascend" or
    "descend" to make it compatible with both the sort function and
    with Matlab.  Change all uses of "ascending" and "descending" in
    existing code to the new options.

 ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
    read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
    However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
    the property will return an empty matrix ([]).

 ** We now require the FFTW library to perform FFT calculations.  The
    FFTPACK sources have been removed from Octave.

 ** Deprecated functions.

    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 5.0 and will
    be removed from Octave 7 (or whatever version is the second major
    release after 5.0):
