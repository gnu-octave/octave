# Doxyfile for Doxygen 1.8.11

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for GNU Octave.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "GNU Octave"

# The public stable API version (unrelated to the internal API version).

PROJECT_NUMBER         = @PACKAGE_VERSION@

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations, mostly compatible with Matlab"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = @abs_top_builddir@/etc/icons/octave-logo-48.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = @abs_top_builddir@/doc

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = YES

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII
# characters will be escaped, for example _xE3_x81_x84 will be used for Unicode
# U+3044.
# The default value is: NO.

ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES    = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
# Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages),
# Korean, Korean-en (Korean with English messages), Latvian, Lithuanian,
# Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,

# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member
# descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class
# documentation (similar to Javadoc). Set to NO to disable this.
# The default value is: YES.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the brief
# description of a member or function before the detailed description
#
# Note: If both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.
# The default value is: YES.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then
# Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief
# description.
# The default value is: NO.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = NO

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = @abs_top_srcdir@

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first
# line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style comment as the brief description. If
# set to NO, the Qt-style will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus
# requiring an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)
# The default value is: NO.

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES then an undocumented member inherits the
# documentation from any documented member that it re-implements.
# The default value is: YES.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES then doxygen will produce a new
# page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will be part
# of the file/class/namespace that contains it.
# The default value is: NO.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 2

# If the MARKDOWN_SUPPORT tag is enabled then doxygen pre-processes all comments
# according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable
# documentation. See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.
# The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you can
# mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting. Disable only in
# case of backward compatibilities issues.
# The default value is: YES.

MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = YES

# When enabled doxygen tries to link words that correspond to documented
# classes, or namespaces to their corresponding documentation. Such a link can
# be prevented in individual cases by putting a % sign in front of the word or
# globally by setting AUTOLINK_SUPPORT to NO.
# The default value is: YES.

AUTOLINK_SUPPORT       = YES

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC
# tag is set to YES then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.
# The default value is: NO.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = YES

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This
# cache is used to resolve symbols given their name and scope. Since this can be
# an expensive process and often the same symbol appears multiple times in the
# code, doxygen keeps a cache of pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small
# doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest
# the optimal cache size from a speed point of view.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9, default value: 0.

LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE      = 2

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PACKAGE tag is set to YES, all members with package or internal
# scope will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PACKAGE        = NO

# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes (and structs) defined
# locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO,
# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES


# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base name of
# the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default anonymous namespace
# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = YES

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation that is typed after a
# \internal command is included. If the tag is set to NO then the documentation
# will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = NO

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the FORCE_LOCAL_INCLUDES tag is set to YES then doxygen will list include
# files with double quotes in the documentation rather than with sharp brackets.
# The default value is: NO.

FORCE_LOCAL_INCLUDES   = YES

# If the INLINE_INFO tag is set to YES then a tag [inline] is inserted in the
# documentation for inline members.
# The default value is: YES.

INLINE_INFO            = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the

# name. If set to NO, the members will appear in declaration order.
# The default value is: YES.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = YES

# If the SORT_BRIEF_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the brief
# descriptions of file, namespace and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO, the members will appear in declaration order. Note that
# this will also influence the order of the classes in the class list.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_BRIEF_DOCS        = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (brief and detailed) documentation of class members so that constructors and
# destructors are listed first. If set to NO the constructors will appear in the
# respective orders defined by SORT_BRIEF_DOCS and SORT_MEMBER_DOCS.
# Note: If SORT_BRIEF_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting brief
# member documentation.
# Note: If SORT_MEMBER_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting
# detailed member documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST = YES


# Set the SHOW_NAMESPACES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Namespaces
# page. This will remove the Namespaces entry from the Quick Index and from the

# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might
# be necessary to disable the index and replace it with your own. The
# DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at top
# of each HTML page. A value of NO enables the index and the value YES disables
# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation
# tree, you can set this option to YES if you also set GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

DISABLE_INDEX          = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph becomes
# larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is visualized
# by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the number of direct
# children of the root node in a graph is already larger than
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note that
# the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.
