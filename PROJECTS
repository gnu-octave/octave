Octave PROJECTS                                          -*- text -*-
===============

Check with bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu for a possibly more current
copy.  Also, if you start working steadily on a project, please let
bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu know.  We might have information that
could help you; we'd also like to send you the GNU coding standards.

This list is not exclusive -- there are many other things that might
be good projects, but it might instead be something we already have,
so check with bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu before you start.

---------
Numerical:
---------

  * Merge control stuff.

  * Improve logm, and sqrtm.

  * Improve complex mapper functions.

  * Make functions like gamma() return the right IEEE Inf or NaN
    values for extreme args or other undefined cases.

  * Handle complex values in fread and fwrite.

  * Support for lp_solve for linear programming problems.

  * Free QP solver.

  * Free NLP solver.

  * Support for sparse matrices.

  * Fix CollocWt to handle Laguerre polynomials.  Make it easy to
    extend it to other polynomial types.

  * Add optional arguments to colloc so that it's not restricted to
    Legendre polynomials.

  * Fix eig to also be able to solve the generalized eigenvalue
    problem, and to solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors without
    performing a balancing step first.

  * Move rand, eye, xpow, xdiv, etc., functions to the matrix classes.

  * Use octave_allocator for memory management in Array classes once
    g++ supports static member templates.

  * Implement the following functions:
    -- ppval    -- cross    -- dot

  * Allow user-supplied gradient information to be passed to NPSOL.

  * Support for FSQP.

  * Convert FSQP style NLP statement to NPSOL style.

  * Convert NPSOL style NLP statement to FSQP style.
    - Look for linear equality constraints, extract corresponding rows
	of C.  The rest are inequality constraints.
    - Look for Nonlinear equality constraints and set up a vector of
	pointers for shuffling.
    - Transform lb <= C*x <= ub, lb != ub, to C*x - ub <= 0 and
	lb - C*x <= 0.  Likewise for lb <= g(x) <= ub.
    - Call FSQP.

  * Optional inputs for fsqp.

  * Allow parameters to be passed through the call to fsolve() to the
    user-supplied function for Matlab compatibility.  Don't place an
    upper limit on the number of arguments.

  * If possible, make economy QR factorization actually take advantage
    of the form of the result instead of just dropping columns.
    Lapack doesn't appear to do this yet.

  * Check matrix classes for proper handling of empty matrices.

  * Improve design of ODE, DAE, classes.

  * Make it possible to specify a time which dassl and lsode should
    not integrate past.

  * Extend meaning of .* to include v .* M or M .* v (where v is a
    column vector with the same number of rows as M) to scale rows of
    M by elements of v.  Similarly, if w is a row vector with as many
    columns as M, then either w .* M or M .* w scales the columns of
    M.

  * Given two vectors x and y of length m and n, implement a function
    outer (x, y, f) that returns an m-by-n matrix with entries
    f (x(i), y(j)).  If f is omitted, multiplication is the default.
    Should probably work for any vectors, not just if x is a column
    vector and y is a row vector.

--------
Graphics:
--------

  * Make plotting with plplot work.

  * Fix interface with gnuplot to wait for gnuplot to output any text
    before octave returns a prompt.  Possible by implementing two
    way communication between gnuplot and Octave.

  * Make gsave (and possibly gload) work.  Implement gsave by having it
    also alter the plot command to not use temporary files (perhaps
    with some user-specified template for naming them) and then
    sending a `save' command to gnuplot.

  * It would be nice to be able to check that a plot is currently
    being displayed.

  * Implement clf, gcf, get, set, orient, print, close, etc. in
    Matlab-compatible ways.

  * Make it possible to check the current graphics terminal type.

  * If possible, pass data to gnuplot without using temporary files.

  * If possible, pass binary data to gnuplot to speed things up.

-------
Strings:
-------

  * Convert string functions to work on string arrays.

  * Make find work for strings.

  * Consider making octave_print_internal() print some sort of text
    representation for unprintable characters instead of sending them
    directly to the terminal.  (But don't do this for fprintf!)

  * Consider changing the default value of `string_fill_char' from SPC
    to NUL.

  * Consider making size ("") ==> [0, 0] for compatibility with
    Matlab, at least when some preference variable is set.

  * Consider making ["test", []] ==> "test", for compatibility with
    Matlab, at least when some set of preferences are set.

----------------
Other Data Types:
----------------

  * New types (char, short, etc.).

  * 3d matrix stuff.

  * Template functions for mixed-type ops.

  * Stuff for arithmetic using charMatrix, intMatrix, etc.

------------------------
Graphical User Interface:
------------------------

  * In an X11 or other windowing environment, allow the user to pop up
    windows for menus and other purposes.  A good place to start might
    be Tk, as long as Tcl is avoided.

  * Add a way to handle events, like alarms, mouse clicks, etc.

------------
Input/Output:
------------

  * Make fread and fwrite work for complex data.  Iostreams based
    versions of these functions would also be nice, and if you are
    working on them, it would be good to support other size
    specifications (integer*2, etc.).

  * Make load and save work for structures.

  * Make load and save look for <file>.mat if only given <file>.

  * Move some pr-output stuff to liboctave.

  * Make the cutoff point for changing to packed storage a
    user-preference variable with default value 8192.

  * Save image data in binary format to save space.

  * Make it possible to load other image formats (ppm, pbm, etc. would
    probably be best since there are already filters to convert to
    these formats from others.)

  * Use HDF for binary data.

  * Make ascii load and save work for Inf and NaN.

  * Complain if there is not enough disk space available (I think
    there is simply not enough error checking in the code that handles
    writing data).

  * Make it possible to tie arbitrary input and output streams
    together, similar to the way iostreams can be tied together.

-----------
Interpreter:
-----------

  * Fix the grammar to allow structure references and index operations
    for for anonymous expressions.  For example, it should be possible
    to write

      localtime (time ()) . hour;

    to get the current hour.  Likewise, it should be possible to write

      svd (A) (1:13);

    to extract the first 13 singular values of the matrix A.

  * Consider grouping all preference variables in a structure instead
    of further polluting the namespace.  Maybe `Octave_options.xxx'?

  * Rewrite functions in input.cc to do the right thing in all cases
    of using readline, forced interactive behavior, echoing of input,
    etc.

  * Make it possible to redefine built-in variables and functions.
    (Fix whatever it is that is happening with clear for built-in
    variables.)

  * Make it possible to check if a variable is complex.

  * Consider making linspace() and logspace() return the value
    corresponding to the first argument if the number of requested
    points is 1.

  * Make it possible to get the names of the arguments that are passed
    to functions, at least if simple variables are passed.

  * Fix name of text-style functions (or at least explain it in the
    manual).

  * Consider allowing an arbitrary property list to be attached to any
    variable.  This could be a more general way to handle the help
    string that can currently be added with `document'.

  * Allow more command line options to be accessible as built-in
    variables (--echo-commands, etc.).

  * Allow `octave -c STRING' to execute commands from STRING then
    exit.

  * Handle DOS style CRLFs in M files.  This should probably be
    optional.

  * Make the interpreter run faster.

  * Make it possible to disable or enable all warnings on an
    individual basis from the command line or via some built-in
    structure variable.

  * Warn about complex comparisons?  Could just use double_value() or
    matrix_value() instead of explicit conversions to real types.

  * Make warnings also give some indication about the location of the
    code that triggers the warning.

  * Warn about complex comparisons?  Could just use double_value() or
    matrix_value() instead of explicit conversions to real types.  For
    this to really be useful, some additional information must be
    available to point to the location of the code that triggers the
    warning.

  * Consider making it possible to have arrays of structures, and some
    way of indexing them.

  * Allow arbitrary lower bounds for array indexing.  (Watch out for
    the additional conflict with zero-one style indexing.)

  * Recursive problems.

  * Improve the way ignore_function_time_stamp works to allow
    selecting by individual directories or functions.  Also,
    optionally allow checking only once between each prompt instead of
    every time the function is called.

  * Make it possible to ask exist() to only look for certain classes
   of variables, functions, files, etc. rather than always looking for
   everything.

  * Add a command-line option to tell Octave to just do syntax
    checking and not execute statements.

  * Is it necessary for do_binary_op and do_unary_op to be friends of
    the tree_constant class.

  * Clean up symtab and variable stuff.

  * Input stream class for parser files -- must manage buffers for
    flex and context for global variable settings.

  * Make LEXICAL_ERROR have a value that is the error message for
    parse_error() to print?

  * Make it possible to clear dynamically loaded functions.

  * Add a run-time alias mechanism that would allow things like

      alias fun function_with_a_very_long_name 

    so that `function_with_a_very_long_name' could be invoked as
    `fun'.

  * What should is_global() return when called for built-in variables?

  * Make it possible to have `static' variables inside functions that
    retain their values across calls.

  * Allow local changes to variables to be written more compactly than
    is currently possible with unwind_protect.  For example,

      function f ()
	local prefer_column_vectors = something;
	...
      endfunction

    would be equivalent to

      function f ()
	unwind_protect
	  save_prefer_column_vectors = prefer_column_vectors;
	  prefer_column_vectors = something;
	  ...
	unwind_protect_cleanup
	  prefer_column_vectors = save_prefer_column_vectors;
	end_unwind_protect
      endfunction

  * Fix all function files to check for bogus inputs (wrong number or
    types of input arguments, wrong number of output arguments).

  * Handle options for built-in functions more consistently.

  * Too much time is spent allocating and freeing memory.  What can be
    done to improve performance?

  * Error output from Fortran code is ugly.  Something should be done to
    make it look better.

  * It would be nice if output from the Fortran routines could be
    passed through the pager.

  * Attempt to recognize common subexpressions in the parser.

  * Remove the buffer size limit in octave_read() in input.cc.

  * Handle arrays with more than two dimensions.

  * Consider making assignment statements like

      M (i_idx, j_idx) = RHS

    produce the value of RHS instead of the value of M.

  * Consider making it possible to specify an empty matrix with a
    syntax like [](e1, e2).  Of course at least one of the expressions
    must be zero...

  * Eliminate force_numeric and make_numeric functions.

  * Is Matrix::fortran_vec() really necessary?

  * print_usage() should set error_state in most cases?

  * Add an option to make Octave quit executing a script when error() is
    called.  Also make it possible for `return' or `break' to exit a
    script.

  * Make statements like this

      foo bar baz

    turn into function calls like this:

      foo ("bar", "baz")

    This is pretty ugly and introduces some conflicts.

  * Make it possible to use text-style function names as variables.

  * Add a command that works like bash's `builtin' command.

  * Handle comments in parse trees for use with the type command.

  * Make the type command handle script files too, by just reading and
    printing them.

  * Clean up eye, eval, feval, keyboard, input, ones, zeros.

  * It would be nice to have an interactive debugger.

  * Make whos report total memory used by variables (and functions?).

  * Rewrite whos and the symbol_record_info class.

-------
History:
-------

  * Add an option to allow saving input from script files in the
    history list.

  * Fix history problems -- core dump if multiple processes are
    writing to the same history file?

------------------------------
Configuration and Installation:
------------------------------

  * Handle USE_READLINE so that --enable-readline will work.

  * Make Octave as independent of the particular readline version as
    possible.

  * Add an --enable-pathsearch option to configure to make it possible
    to configure and run without kpathsea. 

  * Make configure take more defaults from the environment.

  * Should --enable-lite-kernel imply --enable-shared?

  * Make it possible to configure without readline.

  * Makefile changes:
      -- eliminate for loops
      -- define shell commands or eliminate them
      -- verify distclean
      -- consolidate targets

  * Make it possible to configure so that installed binaries and
    shared libraries are stripped.

  * Make installation of the static libraries optional.

------------------------------
Documentation and On-Line Help:
------------------------------

  * Document new features.
      -- history-search-{back,for}ward.
      -- try/catch.
      -- Other stuff mentioned in the NEWS file.

  * Improve the Texinfo Documentation for the interpreter.  It would
    be useful to have lots more examples, to not have so many forward
    references, and to not have very many simple lists of functions.

  * The docs should mention something about efficiency and that using
    array operations is almost always a good idea for speed.

  * Texinfo documentation for the C++ classes.

  * Support multiple info files, perhaps allowing one or more in each
    directory in the LOADPATH, so that local collections of M-files
    could be documented with Info.

  * Figure out a good way to have functions and variables documented
    in only one place.

  * Improve help messages for operators and keywords in help.cc.

  * Make index entries more consistent to improve behavior of `help -i'.

  * Make `help -i' try to find a whole word match first.

  * Allow help for local additions to be accessible with help -i.

  * Make the arrow keys work in the info reader.

  * Update Info to be based on the current Texinfo release.

  * Should info/terminal.c include definitions for PC, BC, UP, and
    ospeed on all systems?

  * Clean up help stuff.

  * Demo files.

  * As the number of m-files with octave grows perhaps a 'Contents.m'
    file for each toolbox (directory) would be appropriate so one
    knows exactly what functions are in a toolbox with a quick look.
    It would be best to generate information for each function directly
    from the M-files, so that the information doesn't have to be
    duplicated, and will remain current if the M-files change.  It
    would also be best to do as much of this as possible in an M-file,
    though I wouldn't mind adding some basic support for listing the
    names of all the directories in the LOADPATH, and the names of all
    the M-files in a given directory if that is needed.

  * Some sort of blurb (2-3 pages) describing Octave in a reasonably
    coherent way, where to get it etc., perhaps formatted pretty,
    i.e. not just text.  Maybe start with the latest Announce file.

-----
Tests:
-----

  * Improved set of tests:

      -- Tests for various functions.  Would be nice to have a test file
	 corresponding to every function.

      -- Tests for element by element operators:
	   +  -  .*  ./  .\  .^  |  &  <  <=  ==  >=  >  !=  ! 

      -- Tests for boolean operators:  &&  ||

      -- Tests for other operators:  *  /  \  '  .'

      -- Tests from bug reports.

      -- Tests for indexed assignment.  Need to consider the following:
	   o fortran-style indexing
	   o zero-one indexing
	   o assignment of empty matrix as well as values
	   o resizing

  * Tests for all internal functions.

-----------
Programming:
-----------

  * Move toward using more stuff from standard C++ library.

  * More C++/Fortran cleanups.

  * It is likely that there are still some memory leaks.  Hunt then down
    and plug them. 

  * Better error messages for missing operators?

  * Eliminate duplicate enums in pt-exp.cc, pt-const.cc, and ov.cc.

  * Handle octave_print_internal() stuff at the liboctave level.  Then
    the octave_value classes could just call on the print() methods
    for the underlying classes.

  * As much as possible, eliminate explicit checks for the types of
    octave_value objects so that user-defined types will automatically
    do the right thing in more cases.

  * Only include config.h in files that actually need it, instead of
    including it in every .cc file.  Unfortunately, this might not be
    so easy to figure out.

  * GNU coding standards:

    -- Add a `Makefile' target to the Makefiles.
    -- Comments on #else and #endif preprocessor commands.
    -- Change error message format to match standards everywhere.

  * Use STL stuff instead of libg++ lists, maps, and stacks.

  * Eliminate more global variables.

  * Encapsulate readline in a class.  Include interface to stuff like
    blink_matching_paren. 

  * Encapsulate resource stuff in a class.

  * Move procstream to liboctave.

  * Replace more C-style vectors with Array<T> stuff.

  * Use references and classes in more places.

  * Share more code among the various *_options functions.

-------------
Miscellaneous:
-------------

  * Implement some functions for interprocess communication:  bind,
    accept, connect, gethostbyname, etc.

  * The installation process should also install octave.el.  This
    needs to detect the appropriate Emacs binary to use to
    byte-compile the .el file.  Following GNU Emacs philosophy,
    installation would be into $(prefix)/share/emacs/site-lisp by
    default, but it should be selectable.

  * The ability to transparently handle very large files:

    Juhana K Kouhia <kouhia@nic.funet.fi> wrote:

      If I have a one-dimensional signal data with the size 400
      Mbytes, then what are my choices to operate with it:

       * I have to split the data
       * Octave has a virtual memory on its own and I don't have to
         worry about the splitting.

      If I split the data, then my easily programmed processing
      programs will become hard to program.

      If possible, I would like to have the virtual memory system in
      Octave i.e. the all big files, the user see as one big array or
      such.  There could be several user selectable models to do the
      virtual memory depending on what kind of data the user have (1d,
      2d) and in what order they are processed (stream or random
      access).

    Perhaps this can be done entirely with a library of M-files.

  * Add a function like strptime() which is the opposite of
    strftime().  A C version is apparently in recent releases of the
    Linux C library.

------
Always:
------

  * Squash bugs.
