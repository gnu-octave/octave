Summary of important user-visible changes for version 6 (yyyy-mm-dd):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### General improvements

- The `edit` function option `"editinplace"` now defaults to `true` and
  the option `"home"` now defaults to the empty matrix `[]`.  Files will
  no longer be copied to the user's HOME directory for editing.  The old
  behavior can be restored by setting `"editinplace"` to `false` and
  `"home"` to `"~/octave"`.

#### Graphics backend

- Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of `"none"`
  which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
  (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with `"ycolor" = "none"`)
  without hiding the entire primitive `"visibility" = "off"`.

- A new property `"FontSmoothing"` has been added to text and axes
  objects that controls whether anti-aliasing is used during the
  rendering of characters.  The default is "on" which produces smooth,
  more visually appealing text.

- The figure property `"windowscrollwheelfcn"`is now implemented.
  This makes it possible to provide a callback function to be executed when
  users manipulate the mouse wheel on a given figure.

- The figure properties `"pointer"`, `"pointershapecdata"`, and
  `"pointershapehotspot"` are now implemented.  This makes it possible
  to change the shape of the cursor (pointer in Matlab-speak) displayed
  in a plot window.

- The appearance of patterned lines `"LineStyle" = ":"|"--"|"-."` has
  been improved for small widths (`"LineWidth"` less than 1.5 pixels)
  which is a common scenario.

- Printing to EPS files now uses a tight bounding box (`"-tight"`
  argument to print) by default.  This makes more sense for EPS
  files which are normally embedded within other documents, and is
  Matlab compatible.  If necessary use the `"-loose"` option to
  reproduce figures as they appeared in previous versions of Octave.

- The following print devices are no longer officially supported: cdr,
  corel, aifm, ill, cgm, hpgl, mf and dxf.  A warning will be thrown
  when using those devices, and the code for supporting those formats
  will eventually be removed from a future version of Octave.

### Matlab compatibility

- Complex RESTful web services can now be accessed by the `webread` and
  `webwrite` functions alongside with the `weboptions` structure.  One
  major feature is the support for cookies to enable RESTful
  communication with the web service.

- The interpreter now supports handles to nested functions.

- The graphics properties `"LineWidth"` and `"MarkerSize"` are now
  measured in points, *not* pixels.  Compared to previous versions
  of Octave, some lines and markers will appear 4/3 larger.
